    Student’s Diary Application is a mobile application that allows store their assignment, 
project, information about their studies. Not only that, users also can generate their own CV/ 
Portfolio based on their activities and information that have been saved on the application. As 
we know, most students in university are usually busy and have less time to store their works
in single and secure place. This application will be going to help them to save all their works 
easier than manually on book or small notes pad. This Application will sort all the information 
that have been saved based on current semester, user also can edit the and delete info that have 
been saved on the application. It is important for students to have a mobile application system 
that can store their information anytime and anywhere. This system will produce good outcome 
for users as it is efficient and easy to use.
